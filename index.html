              <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
              <p>
                Hessaby was born in&nbsp;Tehran&nbsp;to the family of Abbas and
                Goharshad Hessabi. His family’s hometown is&nbsp;Tafresh,
                Central Iran.&nbsp;At the age of four, his family moved
                to&nbsp;Beirut&nbsp;where the young Hessaby attended primary
                school. He was still in&nbsp;secondary school&nbsp;when World
                War I started prompting the closure of his school; Hessaby
                continued his studies at home and in 1922, he earned a degree in
                road engineering from the&nbsp;American University of Beirut.
                After briefly working for the Ministry of Roads, Beirut, Hessabi
                traveled to&nbsp;Paris&nbsp;for further education, he was
                awarded a degree in electrical&nbsp;engineering&nbsp;at the
                École Superieure d’Electricité.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, he was employed by the SNCF (French Electric
                Railway Company). He started working in the electric locomotive
                maintenance department. In the meantime, Hessabi continued his
                studies in physics at Paris-Sorbonne University, obtaining his
                doctorate in 1927. In Paris, he worked&nbsp;Aime Cotton. (Aimé
                Auguste Cotton&nbsp;(9 October 1869 – 16 April 1951) was a
                French physicist known for his studies of the interaction of
                light with&nbsp;chiral molecules. In the&nbsp;absorption
                bands&nbsp;of these molecules, he discovered large values
                of&nbsp;optical rotatory dispersion&nbsp;(ORD), or variation of
                optical rotation as a function of wavelength (Cotton effect), as
                well as&nbsp;circular dichroism&nbsp;or differences of
                absorption between left and right&nbsp;circularly polarized
                light.)
              </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>
                Dr Hessabi was a&nbsp;Polymath, with five bachelor’s degrees in
                literature, civil engineering, mathematics, electrical
                engineering and mining engineering and phd in physics.He was
                well acquainted with the traditional Iranian music as well as
                the classical Western music and played piano and violin
                skillfully. He was active in sports and as a youngster earned
                his living pardy by acting as a swimming instructor and a life
                guard at the Mediterranean coast in Beirut.

                Meanwhile, in a trip to Princeton in 1947 he had the opportunity
                to meet Albert Einstein, discussing his scientific activities
                with him (Ḥesābi, 2000, pp. 127-33). Hessaby was the sole
                Iranian student of Professor Albert Einstein, and during his
                years of scientific research he had meeting and discussions with
                well-known scientists such as Erwin Schrodinger, Max Born,
                Enrico Fermi, Paul Dirac and Neils Bohr and scholars such as
                Russell and Andre Gide.
              </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>

                1920 – March 4, 2011), was
                an&nbsp;Iranian-Armenian&nbsp;astronomer&nbsp;and&nbsp;physicist&nbsp;and
                is called ‘Mother of Modern Iranian Astronomy’.)&nbsp;In June
                1951, Hessabi was appointed to a three-man provincial board of
                the Iranian oil company, the designated successor of
                the&nbsp;Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. In December, 1951, he
                replaced Karim Sanjaby as education minister.&nbsp;Between 1961
                and 1969, Hessabi was Iran’s representative on the Scientific
                and Technical Subcommittee,&nbsp;United Nations Committee on the
